# public_k3s_deployment_repo
*NOTE* This is a public version (without Ansible Vault secrets) to show the ansible deployment of the various workloads onto my K3S cluster in my Homelab. I am still converting over workloads from my old repository.

## Purpose
I decided that I wanted to take back control over my data and host my own services within my home. I started my Homelab in 2022 with a simple intel NUC and it has grown into a 5 host cluster with 108 CPU cores, 548 GB RAM, and over 100 TB of storage!
